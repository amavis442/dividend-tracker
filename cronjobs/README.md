create a python virtual environment

> cd
> python -m venv cloudscraper
> cd cloudscraper
> pip3 install cloudscraper beautifulsoup4

place the contents of python folder in this environment (folder cloudscraper)

Because Globalx uses cloudflare and they have anti-bot counter measurements, cloudscrapper is needed.
It uses cookies and javascript so you also need nodejs. Install nvm for this

https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

> nvm install --lts
