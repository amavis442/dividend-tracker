We have integrated corrugated operations in North America, Brazil and India. We believe we are one of the largest paper recyclers in North America and our recycling operations provide substantially all of the recycled fiber to our mills, as well as to third parties. Our Brazil operations own and operate forestlands that provide virgin fiber to our Brazilian mill.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">We operate an integrated corrugated packaging system that manufactures primarily containerboard, corrugated sheets, corrugated packaging and preprinted linerboard for sale to consumer and industrial products manufacturers and corrugated box manufacturers. We produce a full range of high-quality corrugated containers designed to protect, ship, store, promote and display products made to our customers’ merchandising and distribution specifications. We convert corrugated sheets into corrugated products ranging from one-color protective cartons to graphically brilliant point-of-purchase packaging. Our corrugated container plants serve local customers and regional and large national accounts. Corrugated packaging is used to provide protective packaging for shipment and distribution of food, paper, health and beauty, and other household, consumer, commercial and industrial products. Corrugated packaging may also be graphically enhanced for retail sale, particularly in club store locations. We provide customers with innovative packaging solutions to promote and sell their products. We provide structural and graphic design, engineering services and custom, proprietary and standard automated packaging machines, offering customers turn-key installation, automation, line integration and packaging solutions. We have a machinery solution that creates pouches that replace single-use plastics, including bubble mailers. We also distribute corrugated packaging materials and other specialty packaging products, which include stretch film, void fill, carton sealing tape and other specialty tapes through our network of warehouses and distribution facilities. To make corrugated sheet stock, we feed linerboard and corrugating medium into a corrugator that flutes the medium to specified sizes, glues the linerboard and fluted medium together, and slits and cuts the resulting corrugated paperboard into sheets to customer specifications. Our containerboard mills and corrugated container operations are integrated with the majority of our containerboard production used internally by our corrugated container operations. The balance is either used in trade swaps with other manufacturers or sold domestically and internationally.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">We design, manufacture and, in certain cases, pack temporary displays for sale to consumer products companies and retailers. These displays are used as marketing tools to support new product introductions and specific product promotions in mass merchandising stores, supermarkets, convenience stores, home improvement stores and other retail locations. We also design, manufacture and, in some cases, pre-assemble permanent displays for these customers. We make temporary displays primarily from corrugated paperboard. Unlike temporary displays, permanent displays are restocked with our customers’ product; therefore, they are constructed primarily from metal, plastic, wood and other durable materials. We provide contract packing services, such as multi-product promotional packing and product manipulation, such as multipacks and onpacks. We manufacture and distribute&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">point of sale material utilizing litho, screen and digital printing technologies. We manufacture lithographic laminated packaging for sale to our customers that require packaging with high quality graphics and strength characteristics.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Our recycling operations primarily procure recovered paper (also known as recycled fiber) from our converting facilities and from third parties, such as factories, warehouses, commercial printers, office complexes, grocery and retail stores, document storage facilities, paper converters and other wastepaper collectors. We handle a wide variety of grades of recovered paper, including old corrugated containers, office paper, box clippings, newspaper and print shop scraps. We operate recycling facilities that collect, sort, grade and bale recovered paper and, after sorting and baling, we transfer it to our mills for processing or sell it principally to manufacturers of paperboard or containerboard in the United States (“U.S.”), as well as manufacturers of tissue, newsprint, roofing products and insulation, and to export markets. We operate a nationwide fiber marketing and brokerage system that serves large regional and national accounts, as well as our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills, and sells scrap materials from our converting businesses and mills. Many of our recycling facilities are located close to our recycled containerboard and paperboard mills, which helps promote the availability of supply with reduced shipping costs. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we began conducting our recycling operations primarily as a procurement function, shifting its focus to the procurement of low cost, high quality fiber for our mill system. As a result, we no longer record recycling net sales and the margin from these operations has reduced cost of goods sold.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Sales of corrugated packaging products to external customers accounted for 64.2%, 59.0% and 60.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See “Note 7. Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, for additional information.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Consumer Packaging Segment</b><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">We operate integrated virgin and recycled fiber paperboard mills and consumer packaging converting operations, which convert items such as folding and beverage cartons, interior partitions, inserts and labels. Our integrated system of virgin and recycled mills produces paperboard for our converting operations and third parties. We internally consume or sell to manufacturers of folding cartons and other paperboard products our coated natural kraft, bleached paperboard and coated recycled paperboard, and internally consume or sell to manufacturers of solid fiber interior packaging, tubes and cores, book covers and other paperboard products our specialty recycled paperboard. The mill owned by our Seven Hills Paperboard LLC (“Seven Hills”) joint venture in Lynchburg, VA manufactures gypsum paperboard liner for sale to our joint venture partner.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">We are one of the largest manufacturers of folding and beverage cartons in North America. We believe we are the largest manufacturer of solid fiber partitions in North America measured by net sales. Our folding and beverage cartons are used to package items such as food, paper, beverages, dairy products, tobacco, confectionery, health and beauty and other household consumer, commercial and industrial products, primarily for retail sale. Our folding and beverage cartons are also used by our customers to attract consumer attention at the point-of-sale. We manufacture express mail packages for the overnight courier industry, provide inserts and labels, as well as rigid packaging and other printed packaging products, such as transaction cards (e.g., credit, debit, etc.), brochures, product literature, marketing materials (such as booklets, folders, inserts, cover sheets and slipcases) and grower tags and plant stakes for the horticultural market. For the global healthcare market, we manufacture secondary packages designed to enhance patient adherence for prescription drugs, as well as paperboard packaging for over-the-counter and prescription drugs. Our customers generally use our inserts and labels to provide customer product information either inside a secondary package (e.g., a folding carton) or affixed to the outside of a primary package (e.g., a bottle). Folding cartons typically protect customers’ products during shipment and distribution, and employ graphics to promote them at retail. We manufacture folding and beverage cartons from recycled and virgin paperboard, laminated paperboard and various substrates with specialty characteristics, such as grease masking and microwaveability. We print, coat, die-cut and glue the cartons to customer specifications and ship finished cartons to customers for assembling, filling and sealing. We employ a broad range of offset, flexographic, gravure, backside printing, coating and finishing technologies, as well as iridescent, holographic, textured and dimensional effects to provide differentiated packaging products, and support our customers with new package development, innovation and design services and package testing services. We manufacture and sell our solid fiber and corrugated partitions and die-cut paperboard components principally to glass container manufacturers and producers of beer, food, wine, spirits, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, and to the automotive industry.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Sales of consumer packaging products to external customers accounted for 35.7%, 40.1% and 37.8% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

We expect to complete the monetization of these holdings during fiscal 2020. Sales in our Land and Development segment to external customers accounted for 0.1%, 0.9% and 1.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See “Note 7.

Certain of our virgin containerboard is manufactured with some recycled fiber content. Recycled fiber prices and virgin fiber prices can fluctuate significantly. While virgin fiber prices have generally been more stable than recycled fiber prices, they also fluctuate, particularly due to significant changes in weather, such as during prolonged periods of heavy rain or drought, or during housing construction slowdowns or accelerations.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Containerboard and paperboard are the primary raw materials used by our converting operations. Our converting operations use many different grades of containerboard and paperboard. We supply substantially all of our converting operations\' needs for containerboard and paperboard from our own mills and through the use of trade swaps with other manufacturers. These arrangements allow us to optimize our mill system and reduce freight costs. Because there are other suppliers that produce the necessary grades of containerboard and paperboard used in our converting operations, we believe we would be able to source significant replacement quantities from other suppliers in the event that we incur production disruptions for recycled or virgin containerboard and paperboard. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs For, or Inadequate Availability of, Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Energy</b><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Energy is one of the most significant costs of our mill operations. The cost of natural gas, coal, oil, electricity and wood by-products (biomass) at times has fluctuated significantly. In our recycled paperboard mills, we use primarily natural gas and electricity, supplemented with coal and fuel oil to generate steam used in the paper making process and, at a few mills, to generate electricity used on site. In our virgin fiber mills, we use natural gas, biomass and coal to generate steam used in the pulping and paper making processes and to generate some or all of the electricity used on site. We primarily use electricity and natural gas to operate our converting facilities. We generally purchase these products from suppliers at market or tariff rates. See Item 1. “Business — Governmental Regulation — Environmental and Other Matters” for additional information. See also Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs For, or Inadequate Availability of, Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”. See also Item 7A. “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — “Energy” and “Derivative Instruments / Forward Contracts”.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Transportation</b><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Inbound and outbound freight is a significant expenditure for us. Factors that influence our freight expense are distance between our shipping and delivery locations, distance from our facilities to our customers and suppliers, mode of transportation (rail, truck, intermodal and ocean) and freight rates, which are influenced by supply and demand and fuel costs. We experienced continued higher freight costs in fiscal 2019. The principal markets for our products are in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We May Face Increased Costs For, or Inadequate Availability of, Raw Materials, Energy and Transportation”.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><b style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Sales and Marketing</b><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">None of our top ten external customers individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019. We generally manufacture our products pursuant to customers’ orders. We believe that we have good relationships with our customers. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors — We Depend on Certain Large Customers”.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">As a result of our vertical integration, our mills’ sales volumes may be directly impacted by changes in demand for our packaging products. During fiscal 2019, approximately two-thirds of our coated natural kraft tons shipped, approximately three-fifths of our coated recycled paperboard tons shipped and approximately one-fifth of our bleached paperboard tons shipped were delivered to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture folding and beverage cartons, and approximately three-fourths of our containerboard tons shipped, including trade swaps and buy/sell transactions, were delivered to our converting operations to manufacture corrugated products. Under the terms of our Seven Hills joint venture arrangement, our joint venture partner is required to purchase all of the qualifying gypsum paperboard liner produced by Seven Hills. Excluding the production from Seven Hills and from our Aurora, IL facility, which is converted into book covers and other products, approximately one-third of our specialty recycled paperboard tons shipped in fiscal 2019 were delivered to our converting operations, primarily to manufacture interior partitions. We have the ability to move our internal sourcing among certain of our mills to optimize the efficiency of our operations.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">As a result of our broad portfolio of differentiated and sustainable paper and packaging solutions, we serve over <span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">15,000 customers</span>, including over 150 customers that buy at least $1 million from each of our segments. We believe that our ability to leverage our full portfolio of differentiated solutions and capabilities enables us to set ourselves apart from our competitors.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">We market our products primarily through our own sales force. We also market a number of our products through independent sales representatives, independent distributors or both. We generally pay our sales personnel a combination of base salary, commissions and annual bonus. We pay our independent sales representatives on a commission basis. Orders from our customers generally do not have significant lead times.

Our containerboard and paperboard operations compete with integrated and non-integrated national and regional companies operating primarily in North America, and to a limited extent, manufacturers outside of North America. Our competitors include large and small, vertically integrated companies and numerous smaller non-integrated companies. In the corrugated packaging and folding and beverage carton markets, we compete with a significant number of national, regional and local packaging suppliers in North America and abroad. In the solid fiber interior packaging, promotional point-of-purchase display and converted paperboard products markets, we primarily compete with a smaller number of national, regional and local companies offering highly specialized products.</span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Because all of our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments, we regularly discuss sales opportunities for new business or for renewal of existing business with customers. Our packaging products compete with packaging made from other materials, including plastics. The primary competitive factors we face include <span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">price, design, product innovation, quality, service and, most recently, sustainability,</span> with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line and customer preferences. Our machinery solutions represent one example of how we provide differentiated solutions and create value for our customers. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">We believe that we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors and we obtain feedback on our performance with customer surveys, among other means.</span></span><br></p><p style=\"text-align: justify; \"><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The industries in which we operate have undergone consolidation. Within the packaging products industry, larger customers, with an expanded geographic presence, have tended to seek suppliers that can, because of their broad geographic presence, efficiently and economically supply all or a range of their packaging needs. In addition, our customers continue to demand higher quality products meeting stricter quality control requirements. Demand for sustainable products also impacts our industry.

More importantly, 5G goes well beyond simply making the mobile communications experience better by increasing reliability, adding new features, and enhancing data rates. It is creating a market for diverse and transformative applications driven by the ability to deliver greater speeds, bandwidth and capacity, significantly lower latency, and more secure connectivity.</p><p><br></p><p>In fact, 5G connections will approach ten to 100 times faster than 4G speeds. To put this in perspective, downloading a full-length HD movie in 3G took one day; in 4G, the same file took minutes. On a 5G network, this content can be downloaded in mere seconds. 5G will also enable increasingly efficient and safe vehicle communication, paving the way for autonomous vehicles as well as networks that could make wireless healthcare a reality.</p><p><br></p><p>At the same time, connectivity is expanding into an adjacent set of IoT markets. From smart homes to the smart grid and from industrial to wearables, the number of connected devices is rapidly proliferating. IHS Markit Ltd. projects the IoT market to grow from an installed base of 15 billion units in 2015 to more than 75 billion units by 2025. Skyworks is enabling these opportunities with highly customized system solutions supporting a broad set of wireless protocols including cellular LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth®, LoRa®, Thread, and Zigbee®.</p><p><br></p><p>Looking forward, we see a market that presents a significant growth opportunity for our industry and for Skyworks. The key catalysts for Skyworks will continue to be the insatiable demand for data and the profitable usage model, as each connection becomes more valuable and the world embraces 5G. According to a June 2019 Ericsson “Mobility Report,” there are expected to be 1.9 billion mobile 5G subscriptions globally by the end of 2024 driven by “rapid early momentum and enthusiasm” in the global market. 5G technology will also support the tens of billions of connected devices, smart objects, and embedded sensors expected to come online as the IoT becomes mainstream.</p><div><br></div>'),(60,73,'Intro','<p><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: DDG_ProximaNova, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_0, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_1, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_2, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_3, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_4, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_5, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_6, &quot;Proxima Nova&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Nimbus Sans L&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, &quot;Open Sans&quot;, FreeSans, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px;\">Virgin Galactic, opgericht in 2004, is een bedrijf dat deel uitmaakt van de Virgin Group van Richard Branson, dat van plan is bemande ruimtevluchten aan te bieden aan het betalend publiek, en </span><span style=\"font-family: DDG_ProximaNova, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_0, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_1, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_2, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_3, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_4, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_5, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_6, &quot;Proxima Nova&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Nimbus Sans L&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, &quot;Open Sans&quot;, FreeSans, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">daarnaast ook satellieten te lanceren</span><span style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: DDG_ProximaNova, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_0, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_1, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_2, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_3, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_4, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_5, DDG_ProximaNova_UI_6, &quot;Proxima Nova&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Nimbus Sans L&quot;, &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, &quot;Open Sans&quot;, FreeSans, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14.4px;\">.

We have made significant investments in performing customer segmentation analyses and data analytics to gain insight into our guests’ decision-making process and vacation needs enabling us to identify new marketing opportunities and further grow our share of their vacation spend.

As of November 30, 2018, we have a total of 21 cruise ships scheduled to be delivered through 2025. Some of these ships will replace existing capacity as less efficient ships exit our fleet. Since 2006, we have sold 28 ships and our newbuild program has been designed to consider an expected acceleration in our fleet replacement cycle over time. Furthermore, we continue to make substantial investments in our existing ship enhancement programs to improve our onboard product offerings and enrich our guests’ vacation experiences.</span><br></p><div><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">We continue to grow our presence in established markets and increase our penetration in developing markets, such as Asia.

Global Cruise Industry</u></p><p><b>I. Overview</b></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Cruising offers a broad range of products and services to suit vacationing guests of many ages, backgrounds and interests. Cruise brands can be broadly classified as offering contemporary, premium and luxury cruise experiences. The contemporary experience typically includes cruises that last seven days or less and have a more casual ambiance. The premium experience typically includes cruises that last from seven to 14 days and appeal to those who are more affluent. Premium cruises emphasize quality, comfort, style and more destination-focused itineraries. The luxury experience is usually characterized by very high standards of accommodation and service, smaller vessel size and exotic itineraries to ports that are inaccessible to larger ships. We have product and service offerings in each of these three broad classifications.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"><b>II. Favorable Characteristics of the Global Cruise Industry</b></span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">a.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;High Guest Satisfaction Rates</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Cruise guests tend to rate their overall satisfaction with a cruise vacation higher than comparable land-based hotel and resort vacations. According to industry surveys, the cruise experience consistently exceeds expectations of repeat and first-time cruisers. Cruising continues to receive high guest satisfaction rates because of the unique vacation experiences it offers, including visiting multiple destinations without having to pack and unpack, all-inclusive product offerings and state-of-the-art cruise ships with entertainment, relaxation and fun, all at an outstanding value.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">b.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Positive Demand Trends</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Social media has a powerful impact on consumer behavior. Technology allows people to instantly share travel experiences within their social networks. Seeing others embrace travel and experience the world in new ways inspires people to travel themselves. Consumers are looking to experiences and learning for personal fulfillment. Today’s travelers are looking for immersive, meaningful and memorable travel experiences. While it is useful for the cruise industry to consider travel markets across demographic groups, the ability to identify and address target markets based on “psychographics” or attitudes that cut across demographics is even more meaningful. We believe the cruise industry is well positioned to meet travelers’ desires and has the ability to tailor experiences for each guest based on their unique wants and needs, which should foster growth for the cruise industry.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">From a demographic perspective, two age groups, the Baby Boomers and the Millennial generations, have in recent years experienced trends that positively affect demand for cruising. Cruising benefits from the aging of the Baby Boomer and Millennial generations. In North America alone, the number of Baby Boomers at retirement age increases from 48 million in 2015 to 56 million in 2020 and 74 million by 2030. The Baby Boomer generation likes to pursue an active lifestyle and has the desire and the means to travel and enjoys multi-generational cruising. The Millennial generation has surpassed the size of the Baby Boomer generation and represents the fastest growing demographic segment of the vacation industry. This group expresses a strong desire to travel and share new experiences, a mindset that should continue to foster growth for the industry. A recent study by the American Society of Travel Agents (“ASTA”) indicates that the Millennial generation is even more likely to cruise and more likely to enjoy cruises than the Baby Boomer generation.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">These changes in consumer behavior and demographics, along with growing populations, increasing wealth in developing countries and increased spending by consumers on experience versus products, will continue to drive demand for travel and the&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">global cruise industry. These groups of consumers are becoming eager to experience the world through travel, which provides significant growth opportunity for the cruise industry within and beyond the established markets.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">c.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wide Appeal</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Cruising appeals to a broad range of ages and income levels. Cruising provides something for every generation, from kids’ clubs to an array of onboard entertainment designed to appeal to teens and adults. Cruising also offers transportation to a variety of destinations and a diverse range of ship types and sizes, as well as price points, to attract guests with varying tastes and income levels. To encourage first-time and repeat cruisers and better compete with other vacation alternatives the cruise industry has in recent years refocused its marketing efforts, enhanced training of travel agents and collaborated with well-known brands and offers the following:</span><br></p><p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; Expanded entertainment options and shipboard activities</p><p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; Enhanced internet and communication capabilities</p><p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; Flexible dining options including open-seating dining</p><p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; Beverage package options</p><p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; Branded specialty restaurants, bars and cafés</p><p>•&nbsp; &nbsp; Money-back guarantees</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">d.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Large Addressable Markets</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The global cruise industry is a relatively small part of the wider global vacation industry, which includes a large variety of land-based vacation alternatives. Therefore, we believe there are large, addressable markets with low penetration rates. The penetration rates below were computed based on the 2017 global cruise guests carried from G.P. Wild (International Limited) (“G.P. Wild”), an independent cruise research company, as a percentage of total population:</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">•&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">5.1% for Australia and New Zealand</span></p><p>•&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">3.5% for the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada</span></p><p>•&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2.9% for the United Kingdom (“UK”)</span></p><p>•&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">2.1% for Germany and Italy</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">We also believe Asia is a large addressable market, where economic growth has raised discretionary income levels, fueling an increasing demand for travel.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">e.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Exceptional Value Proposition</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">We believe the cost of a cruise vacation represents exceptional value in comparison to alternative land-based vacations. Cruising delivers unique benefits, such as transportation to various destinations while also providing accommodations, a diversity of food choices and a selection of daily entertainment options for one all-inclusive, competitive price. To make cruising even more cost effective and more easily accessible to vacationers, the cruise industry typically offers a number of drive-to home ports, which enables many cruise guests to reduce their overall vacation costs by eliminating or reducing air and other transportation costs.</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">f.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ship Mobility</span><br></p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The mobility of cruise ships enables cruise companies to move their vessels between regions in order to maximize profitability and to meet changing demand. For example, brands can change itineraries over time in order to cater to our guests’ tastes or as general economic or geopolitical conditions warrant. In addition, cruise companies have the flexibility to reposition capacity to areas with growing demand. We believe that this unique ability to move ships provides the cruise industry with a competitive advantage compared to other land-based vacation alternatives.</span><br></p>'),(62,77,'Brands','<p><span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, sans-serif;\">Carnival Corporation &amp; plc, the world’s largest leisure travel company, provides travelers around the globe with extraordinary vacations at an exceptional value.

Instead of targeting net lease properties in overcrowded sectors, it focuses on \"nichier\" property types that lack institutional demand. This includes movie theaters, golf complexes, water parks and other experiential properties. High net worth individuals and smaller family offices do not enter this space because owning one or two property is too risky. EPR has a real competitive advantage in this space because diversification and specialized knowledge are needed. Due to the relative lack of demand, cap rates much more lucrative at closer to 8%.</font></p><p><font face=\"Verdana, Arial, helvetica, sans-serif\">This strategy has generated massive outperformance during the past 20-plus years and EPR is today stronger than ever before.

Our portfolio investments are typically made to support management buyouts, recapitalizations, growth financings, refinancings and acquisitions of companies that operate in diverse industry sectors. We seek to partner with entrepreneurs, business owners and management teams and generally provide \"one stop\" financing alternatives within our lower middle market portfolio.

We believe that the lower middle market is a highly attractive segment of the overall market that provides unique and highly valuable equity investment opportunities for Main Street Capital. We believe that these unique equity investments provide for potential realized and unrealized gains to offset any potential credit losses and impairments relating to our debt investments and the opportunity for us to grow our net asset value (NAV) per share over time as these lower middle market portfolio companies perform and the value of our equity investments in these companies increase. We believe this unique investment strategy has provided superior returns to our shareholders for more than a decade. In contrast, most other BDCs primary focus is on debt investments only.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">In addition, we are an internally managed BDC whereas the vast majority of other BDCs are externally managed.</span><br></p><h3>What does it mean that Main Street Capital is an internally managed BDC?</h3><p>Internally managed means that we are structured much like a typical operating company, with employees that are solely focused on Main Street Capital’s operating activities and with the significant benefits of a typical corporate governance structure relating to the compensation of our employees. As a result, the compensation that we provide to our employees is based on a combination of the overall financial performance and operating achievements of the company and the individual performance of our employees. As a result of these benefits, we believe that the internally managed structure better aligns the interests of our employees and shareholders. In contrast, an externally managed BDC does not have employees and is instead managed by a third-party management firm that charges the BDC an operating cost based on a percentage of assets plus certain incentive fees, meaning that an externally managed BDC’s operating costs will automatically increase as the BDC’s assets increase, irrespective of the BDC’s operating performance. Our internally managed structure has resulted in an overall cost to manage our business that is significantly lower than the average BDC, and such benefits can be measured by comparing Main Street Capital’s ratio of operating cost, excluding interest expense, as a percentage of total assets and Main Street Capital’s efficiency ratio to the average ratios for other BDCs. More details on our internally managed structure and the ratio comparisons can be found in our quarterly Investor Presentation located at our Investors page at https://ir.mainstcapital.com/.</p><h3>Does Main Street Capital manage other funds?</h3><p>Yes, we are the sub-advisor for the HMS Income Fund (https://www.hinessecurities.com/past-offerings/hms-income-fund/), a non-listed BDC that has total assets in excess of $1 billion. We receive 50% of the investment advisor’s base management fee, which equates to 1% of the total assets of HMS Income Fund, and have the opportunity to earn incentive fees under this sub-advisory relationship based upon the fund’s performance. Due to our unique internally managed structure, the benefits derived from this sub-advisory relationship are included in our financial results and therefore passed on to our shareholders.</p><h3>What is Main Street Capital’s strategy in terms of how much debt it maintains in its capital structure, or leverage it employs in the execution of its investment strategy?</h3><p>The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for strict regulations limiting how much leverage a BDC can employ. Prior to 2018, a BDC was required to maintain an asset to debt coverage ratio of at least 2.0x. In March 2018, BDCs were provided the opportunity to increase leverage through the passage of the Small Business Credit Availability Act, which decreased the required asset to <b>debt coverage ratio to 1.5x</b>, provided the BDC seeking to employ the additional leverage received prior board of director or shareholder approval. We have historically maintained conservative levels of leverage and have proven that our business model does not require the additional leverage provided by this legislation. Therefore, to date, we have not elected to seek approval for the additional leverage.</p><h3>Where is Main Street Capital\'s common stock listed?</h3><p>Our common stock is listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol MAIN. For more detailed stock information, please visit our Investors/Listed Securities Info page at https://ir.mainstcapital.com/listed-securities-information.</p><h3>Can I purchase shares directly from Main Street Capital?</h3><p>Yes, we have a Direct Stock Purchase Plan (“DSPP”) that provides new and existing shareholders the ability to purchase shares of our common stock directly from us without paying any trading fees, brokerage commissions or service fees. Initial purchases of shares may be made between $250 (and $100 if you are a registered shareholder or you sign up for automatic monthly investments) and $25,000, and subsequent investments may be made between $100 and $25,000 per month. You can make optional cash investments by check or by authorizing a one-time debit or automatic monthly deductions from your bank checking or savings account. Sales of shares of our common stock under the DSPP will be effected monthly, on the 15th of each month (or the previous NYSE trading day if the 15th day is not an NYSE trading day) (each, an “Investment Date”). The Plan Administrator must receive full payment for your purchase at least two business days before the relevant Investment Date.&nbsp; You will not pay any trading fees, brokerage commissions or service fees on common stock purchased through the DSPP. You will, however, be responsible for any trading fees, brokerage commissions or service fees paid in connection with your sale of shares from the DSPP, termination of your account and for other actions as described in the DSPP.

In order to maintain the benefits of our “regulated investment company”, or a “RIC”, tax structure for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which provides us the opportunity to avoid corporate income tax if we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our shareholders, we generally do not retain our taxable income. <span style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);\">As a result, we have in the past, and will continue in the future to require additional equity issuances to fund our growth. </span>In addition, due to the unique nature of our investment strategy, which includes making equity investments with long-term or indefinite holding periods, we believe that it is important to fund a significant portion of our capital needs with equity issuances.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">To facilitate these equity issuances as necessary to fund our growth, we currently maintain a program with certain selling agents through which we can sell shares of our common stock through at-the-market (“ATM”) offerings, and we seek to utilize our ATM program for these needs.</span><br></p><h3>What is the CUSIP number for Main Street Capital’s common stock?</h3><p>The CUSIP number for our common stock is 56035L104.</p><h3>Where can I find information on Main Street Capital\'s net asset value?</h3><p>The quarterly net asset value per share may be obtained in our public filings (our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K) with the Securities and Exchange Commission via its website www.sec.gov or by accessing our SEC Filings page at https://ir.mainstcapital.com/all-sec-filings.</p><h3>Does Main Street Capital pay a Dividend?</h3><p>Yes, we pay dividends to our shareholders of record on a <b>monthly basis</b>. Since 2013, we have also paid semi-annual supplemental dividends to our shareholders. To view our historical dividends, please visit our Investors/Listed Securities Information/Dividends page at https://ir.mainstcapital.com/dividends.</p><h3>Why does Main Street Capital pay semi-annual supplemental dividends and does it plan to continue to pay these dividends in the future?</h3><p>Due to our unique investment strategy, which includes making equity investments in lower middle market companies, we have historically generated substantial realized gains from our equity investments and we are generally required to pay out these gains in the form of dividends to maintain our regulated investment company tax status. Beginning in 2013, we chose to distribute these realized gains to our shareholders in the form of supplemental dividends in an attempt to better match the periodic nature of the realized gains. Since that time our business model and investment portfolio have matured and our current intention is to fully absorb the semi-annual supplemental dividends into the regular monthly dividends, and in the process maintain and grow our total combined annual dividends, by gradually reducing the semi-annual supplemental dividends while increasing the regular monthly dividends over multiple years beginning in 2019.</p><h3>Does Main Street Capital have a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”)?</h3><p>Yes, the DRIP provides registered shareholders who hold their shares with American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company LLC (\"AST\"), our transfer agent and registrar, and shareholders holding shares of our common stock through certain brokerage firms that have elected to participate in the DRIP, the ability to purchase additional shares of our common stock automatically by reinvesting all or a portion of their cash dividends paid on shares of our common stock. The DRIP is an \"opt-out\" program. Therefore, if we declare a cash dividend, registered shareholders who have not elected to receive dividends in cash will have their cash dividend automatically reinvested into additional shares of our common stock. Non-participating brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries may provide a similar dividend reinvestment program. If you hold your shares through a bank, broker or other intermediary, please contact your bank, broker or other intermediary to inquire about their dividend reinvestment options. For more information on the DRIP, please visit our Investors/Listed Securities info/Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan page at https://ir.mainstcapital.com/dividend-reinvestment-and-direct-stock-purchase-plan.</p><h3>Are dividends taxable to shareholders and, if so, at what rate?</h3><p>Following the end of each year we provide a Form 1099-DIV and a tax status letter to our shareholders that describe the tax characteristics of the dividends paid in the preceding year, including a breakdown between ordinary income, capital gains and qualified dividends. DRIP participants are taxed on the dividends as if they had received cash. For information on the tax status of our historical dividends, please visit our Investors/Listed Securities Information/Tax Information page at https://ir.mainstcapital.com/tax-information. For information about taxes in respect of dividends received by you, you should consult your own tax advisor.</p><h3>Are dividends paid by Main Street Capital subject to Unrelated Business Income Tax (“UBIT”)?</h3><p>Unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) is income that a tax-exempt entity, such as a charitable organization, religious organization, qualified retirement trust, university, or other similar organization, earns from business activities that are not substantially related to the performance of the organization\'s exempt purpose and thus does not qualify for exemption from UBTI. In addition, an individual retirement account (“IRA”) can also earn active business income from the investments held by the IRA and UBTI earned in excess of certain statutory limits can cause certain additional tax reporting requirements and tax obligations for the IRA. Since we are a regulated investment company, or a “RIC”, which is a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we are able to act as a “blocker” and “shield” against UBTI and we can therefore pass the income and gains we earn through to our shareholders as dividends that are not subject to UBIT.</p><h3>Which research analysts provide research coverage and analysis on Main Street Capital?</h3><p>Please see the last page of our quarterly Investor Presentation located at our Investors/News &amp; Events/Presentations page at https://ir.mainstcapital.com/presentations to view a detailed list of the analysts who follow the company.</p><h3>Am I a registered shareholder?</h3><p>You are a registered shareholder if you hold shares of Main Street Capital common stock registered in your name and you either hold a certificate representing such shares or such shares are held in book-entry form with American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company LLC (\"AST\"), our transfer agent and registrar. If your shares are not registered in your name, but instead are held in the name of your bank, broker or other intermediary, your securities are considered to be held in “street name.”</p><h3>Who do I contact with questions concerning my account activity, replacing lost or stolen certificates, transferring securities, dividend payments, direct deposit information, or processing a change of address?</h3><p>Registered shareholders should contact American Stock Transfer &amp; Trust Company LLC (\"AST\"), our transfer agent and registrar, by telephone at (800) 937-5449 or by visiting their website at www.astfinancial.com with any questions.</p><p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Shareholders who hold their shares in “street name” through a bank, broker or other intermediary should contact their bank, broker or other intermediary with any questions.</span><br></p><p><a href=\"https://ir.mainstcapital.com/faq\" style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-size: 1rem;\">https://ir.mainstcapital.com/faq</a><br></p>'),(74,92,'Intro','<p>STORE Capital Corp is a real estate investment trust involved in the acquisition and management of single tenant operation real estate, or STORE, properties across the U.S. STORE Capital primarily leases facilities at which a company operates its business and generates sales to middle-market and large businesses through long-term agreements.
